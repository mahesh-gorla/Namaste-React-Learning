> > Bundlers:
> > -Bundler make minify our code and makes it visble us to -as a single line code and it does lot more things. some -example bundlers are as below.

VITE
PARCEL
WEBPACK

> Create-react-app uses webpack

-there is no official name for npm

> ~ Tild
> ^ Carat

> tild vs carat

> version: 1.2.3
> : major . minor . patch

** PARCEL IS A BEAST **
Parcel advantages as below:
File watcher algoritham is always looks for if any file changes- which is writtern in C++
HMR - hot module replacement
Bundling
Minifing the code: reduces the the sizes
Cleaning the code by removeing the console.logs
Dev and Prod Build: seperate build files for prod and dev
Super fast build algoritham: build and gives a single html css and -js files
Image Optimization: make reduce the size of the images
Caching while development: when you save it refreshes faster than -your intial build
Compresses your files also
Compatable with older version of the browsers
HTTPS on dev when you serve with --https
Port numbers also take care by parcel
Consitenet hashing algoritham
ZERO config bundler
If react is Modi Parcel is Amit sha.?

<!--
we should put parcel-cache in gitignore
 -->

Percel -> Percel dependecies are transitive dependecies
** PARCEL IS A BEAST **

npm init

npx = npm run
x is execution

npm start === npm run start
